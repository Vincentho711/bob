// This file contains explicit template instantiations for common checker types
// and any non-template utility functions if needed

// Note: Since BaseChecker is a template class, most of its implementation
// is in the header file. This file serves as a placeholder for:
// 1. Explicit template instantiations (if needed for compilation speed)
// 2. Non-template utility functions
// 3. Static member definitions

// Future utility functions can be added here
