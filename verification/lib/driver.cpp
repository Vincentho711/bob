#include "driver.h"

// This file contains explicit template instantiations for common driver types
// and any non-template member functions if needed in the future

// Note: Since BaseDriver is a template class, most of its implementation
// is in the header file. This file serves as a placeholder for:
// 1. Explicit template instantiations (if needed for compilation speed)
// 2. Non-template utility functions
// 3. Static member definitions

// Example explicit instantiation (uncomment if needed):
// #include "Vhello_world_top.h"
// #include "adder_verification/adder_transaction.h"
// template class BaseDriver<Vhello_world_top, AdderTransaction>;

// Future utility functions can be added here
